## Installation

### System Dependencies

First, install the required system packages:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-gi python3-gi-cairo gir1.2-gtk-4.0 python3-opencv python3-numpy
```

### Local Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ojqbo/ht301-thermal-viewer.git
cd ht301-thermal-viewer
```

2. Run the installer script:
```bash
./install.sh
```

This will:
- Check for required system dependencies
- Install the application to your home directory (`~/.local`)
- Create a desktop entry for easy launching

After installation, you can run the application in two ways:
1. From your applications menu (search for "HT301 Thermal Viewer")
2. From the terminal:
```bash
ht301-thermal-viewer
```

Note: You may need to log out and back in for the application to appear in your applications menu.

### Uninstallation

To remove the application, run:
```bash
./uninstall.sh
```

This will remove all application files and desktop entries. Note that system dependencies (python3-gi, python3-opencv, etc.) are not removed by default as they might be needed by other applications.

### Running Without Installation

If you want to run the application directly from the source without installation, you can use:
```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -c "from ht301_thermal_viewer.main import main; main()"
```

Note: This method requires you to be in the project root directory. The application uses relative imports for better package management, which is why we need to set PYTHONPATH to include the `src` directory.
